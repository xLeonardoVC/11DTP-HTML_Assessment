          <p>Blocking in volleyball is a crucial defensive skill that can significantly impact the game. Here are essential techniques and tips to help beginners master blocking.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. This stance allows for quick movement and jumping. Keep your shoulders and hips square to the net to facilitate a straight jump.</li>
            <li>Jump just after the attacker leaves the ground. This timing ensures you are at your peak when they hit the ball, maximizing your chances of a successful block.</li>
            <li>Keep your arms high with elbows at shoulder height and palms facing the net. This position allows for a quicker reaction and better coverage of the net. </li>
            <li>Use a deep squat to generate power for your jump. As you jump, extend your arms upward to reach over the net, pressing your hands down to block the ball effectively. </li>
            <li>Keep your eyes on the ball and the hitter. Anticipating their move can help you position yourself better for the block. </li>
        </ul>
